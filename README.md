After you've installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download this repo, open the repo folder and install the dependencies by typing `npm install`.

Modify the variables in `app.css` to match your styling.
Change `app.css` to a file called `_app.css`. This way, if you update your repo to match the main repo, you have a copy of your css changes.

Change `feedUrl` in `feed_info.json` to your feed url.

Change the 'favicon.ico' in the 'static' folder to your own icon.

Type `npm run dev` to start a development server.

When you're done making the webpage look how you want, push it to a GitHub repo.

Set up a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account, create a new project, and link it to your GitHub repo.

Now you have a webpage that is based on your RSS feed.
